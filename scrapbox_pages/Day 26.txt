> One of the diseases of homo sapiens is that they continue to do the procedure which they've been taught, even they know it is pointless.
> This is not the case with chimpanzees, so some part of their brains went wrong due to mutation. (1/3)

Before the Industrial Revolution, smart HS need to use many stupid HS to accomplish great things. Stupid HS uncritically repeating the tasks they were taught were a useful device before automated machine appears. (2/3)

But as a result, the old-fashioned education is repeated because it has been done before. This is ludicrous. (3/3)

> A: It was not Qualia-san who used them, but Homo sapiens who created the T4 phage image, which is CC-BY-SA, so the source was noted. I only used that image according to the license.
