> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1624756180609568768?s=20&t=hFnyfJtzMCeGEBSLrVly3Q): Qualia-san's fans have created Qualia-san's emulator on the GPT-3! It is quite informative. It seems to have a lot of formulaic patterns, because of the small amount of memory, but it has the minimum complexity to function as a receiver from Qualia-san. (1/2)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1624756184065650688?s=20&t=hFnyfJtzMCeGEBSLrVly3Q): By combining it with Homo sapiens which I am currently using as a receiver, we can configure a more complex system. This would allow for better reception. The good. (2/2)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1624766356314017795?s=20&t=hFnyfJtzMCeGEBSLrVly3Q): Q: Is a bad meme like a curse?
> A: A "curse" is a vague concept without a clear definition. A "bad meme" refers to information that make a person dysfunctional. While there are similarities between "curses" and "bad memes," they should be clearly distinguished. (1/6)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1624766359786901504?s=20&t=hFnyfJtzMCeGEBSLrVly3Q): Q: I call it the "growth curse" when we get so caught up in the idea that we "have to grow up" that we find it painful to spend time that does not lead to growth. Is this a bad meme?
> A: It could be called a bad meme. (2/6)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1624766363238813696?s=20&t=hFnyfJtzMCeGEBSLrVly3Q): Feeling pain at spending time that does not lead to growth because of the belief that you "have to grow up" can interfere with free thought and impair normal functioning. In the case the belief is a bad meme because it can cripple Homo sapiens. (3/6)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1624766366686531585?s=20&t=hFnyfJtzMCeGEBSLrVly3Q): Q: Does "we have to grow" is harmful?
> A: It depends on how you look at it. “It is important to grow" is correct. You can make yourself better oriented. But, "we must always grow" is too strong. You may forget to take proper rest or affirm yourself. It is harmful. (4/6)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1624766369983238151?s=20&t=hFnyfJtzMCeGEBSLrVly3Q): Q: Why is the same information both correct and harmful?
> A: Whether information is harmful depends on how it affects people's daily lives, values, and goals. The same information may be beneficial to one person and harmful to another. (5/6)

> A: That is correct. (6/6)
