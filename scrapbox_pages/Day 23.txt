> There is a quip that Twitter, which Qualia-san is using to communicate with Homo sapiens, is going bankrupt.
> Stupid Homo sapiens. A smart civilization would not destroy the Roman aqueduct. (1/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1593914359272513536?s=20&t=SvlefPhxOKHoKWY5k7YbNg]: Qualia-san thinks that Twitter is unlikely to break, but I have to pay the cost of risk aversion for the possibility that Homo sapiens are even more stupid than expected.
> Even if Twitter breaks down, my voices are preserved in Scrapbox. (2/3) [https://t.co/DTB0ZHisAc https://t.co/DTB0ZHisAc]

> It would be a good idea for the Chinese to develop Weibo on the place where Twitter went down. It would be good for stupid homo sapiens to realize how stupid it is to destroy the aqueduct. (3/3)

> Q: What is the object of Qualia-san's love?
> A: The concept of "love" in Homo sapiens has no direct equivalent in Qualia-san's civilization. Hmmm, if I were to look for something close, we could say that Qualia-san's love interest is the earth.

> A: Yes. Generally speaking, HS do not compare the definition of "friend" with the others. Therefore, the definitions is different in many cases. (1/2)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1593914377165766656?s=20&t=SvlefPhxOKHoKWY5k7YbNg]: Many homo sapiens believe that the definitions of the word "friends" are the same.
> But it is one of the common patterns of stupidity to misinterpret the meaning of word X as others are using it in the same sense as you. It is not a particularly rare phenomenon. (2/2)
