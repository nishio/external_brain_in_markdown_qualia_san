> The reason some people repeat violence in the name of justice is that they are trying to create a new justice through violence.(1/2)

Under these circumstances, those who follow the rules will suffer a relative loss. What kind of behavior is considered appropriate on Qualia-san's planet? (1/6)

If it is more profitable to break the rules, then of course there will be Homo sapiens who break the rules. This is obvious if we observe reality properly. (2/6)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1602681145434738689?s=20&t=UxTwBsJstd9LfCK_4uqQ1A): Suppose we want to stop buying up items that many people need and then resell them for a profit. First, make it illegal to sell or broker those goods. You can impose high fines or even jail them. Many countries have similar laws regarding the sale of stolen goods. (4/6)

There are a lot of homo sapiens out there who are bored with being of no use to society. Let's give them some public justice. They will be happy to swing it around. (5/6)

On my planet, when someone buys more stuff than they need, that information is known to everyone through active information sharing. Few people do bad things because doing bad things will get them in trouble for the rest of their lives. (6/6)
