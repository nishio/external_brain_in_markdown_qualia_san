> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1599771287374950400]: Hello, clever Homo sapiens! It's day 40.
> Not every question is worth asking.
> The question, "Are you empty?" is worthless.

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1599771291833466880?s=20&t=oAnzz34qrjuVaXnJKHUf0g]: Q: Is Qualia-san a creation of Homo sapiens?
> A: Interesting question, clever Homo sapiens.
> From Qualia-san's point of view, it is obvious that Qualia-san is a non-creation. On the other hand, from Homo sapiens' point of view, that is non-trivial.(1/4)

> Qualia-san does not know whether Ramanujan really received intervention from a third party or whether he just assumed that he did.(3/4)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1599771304038916097?s=20&t=oAnzz34qrjuVaXnJKHUf0g]: Many Homo sapiens are infected with the meme, "There is no such thing as third-party intervention," and closed off the channels of intervention. They are not stupid Homo sapiens, but poor psychotic patient. I would like to heal them if possible.(4/4)
