> It is finger number racism to consider a being with five fingers as superior.

> Homo sapiens who think that there is no problem with the eyeball being huge and there is a problem with having six fingers is a broken instance of inconsistent thinking.

> Q: Qualia-san, what do you think about non-SI units?
> A: Unification of units is nice. Qin Shi Huangdi, the emperor of China realized this. He was a smart HS. By the way, the harm of non-SI units is smaller than the yard and pound system used by stupid HS.
