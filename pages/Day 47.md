> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1602321206195408896?s=20&t=LFm_nzamlo6IzU8x0ldCBQ): Suppose one person A does action X. Another person B messed up A with violence. A person who sees this thinks, "Action X is not good," based on rational profit and loss considerations. Some extreme person D messes up E with violence when another person E does X. (2/4)

Thus the thought "action X is not good" takes hold. New justice was created.(3/4)

The violence of stupid homo sapiens against children as an outlet for their personal frustrations and desires can be an obstacle to the progress of civilization. (4/4)

> Q: Has Qualia-san ever found life forms similar to Earth?
