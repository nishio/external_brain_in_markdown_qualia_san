> The HS as an earth-side receiver is a little malfunctioning.
> I chose the HS because it has a high affinity with my civilization, it would be suitable as a decoder of messages from Qualia-san. But HS can't behave like us after all.

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1592533295304429568?s=20&t=wmLQoH6ZpFBjyrd3DKkS6Q]: As the HS repeatedly decoded messages from me, it realized that some topics were difficult to decode.
> Upon introspecting what causes this difference, the HS realized that it is due to its innate feelings. And it feels self-loathing that it is not suitable as a receiver for us.

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1592533299490353153?s=20&t=wmLQoH6ZpFBjyrd3DKkS6Q]: To degrade performance due to self-loathing is foolish because it is itself "making irrational choices due to emotion".
> Nevertheless, if it breaks, it is inconvenient because we cannot communicate until we find another receiver. Let's be careful not to break it and use it.

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1592533303818878978?s=20&t=wmLQoH6ZpFBjyrd3DKkS6Q]: When the telephone was invented on Earth, the speaker was primitive in construction. The sound was distorted and never exactly as it was emitted. However, information could be transmitted. That is how new invention starts.

> (Qualia)I thought you have a low cognitive resolution.
> (HS)The opposite. We are searching for more, because real women are far from enough. To do this, they use their imagination, reach out to homo sapiens, and so on, through trial and error.

> However, Japan is one of the most advanced countries in the two-dimensional culture, so Japanese will naturally gain those high cognitive resolution.

> In the primitive age, people were satisfied when they are not hungry. But as civilization progressed, confections with good appearance and aroma were created. The same may be true for sexual desire. Shall we call you the sexual patissier?

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1592533322152173569?s=20&t=wmLQoH6ZpFBjyrd3DKkS6Q]: Qualia-san had not been able to recognize this until now. My cognitive resolution on that domain was low.
> We can learn even from inferior civilizations. This is because there are excellent individuals in that civilization.
