> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1600872386479345664?s=20&t=6mfuRryvvPxzw-H9sMKYLg]: Hello, clever Homo sapiens! It's day 43.
> 43 is the smallest prime number expressible as the sum of 2~5 different primes!
> I was researching Tezurumozuru (Astrophyton) on Earth. It has a beautiful structure, but it seems to have failed to become civilized.(1/2)

> If something doesn't work, it should be discarded. Homo sapiens has a problem with not discarding what should be discarded.(2/2)

> A: Yes, that's a good question. I guess I lacked the resolution of the concept of "love." Of course I don't love the rocks of the earth.(1/3)

I don't care if they disappear. As it stands, the earth's main source of oxygen production is the excrement of them, so we need a reasonable amount for oxygen-consuming Homo sapiens. (2/3)

> A: The Scrapbox is a place where fans are making archive what Qualia-san has to say. Qualia-san herself is not active there. (1/2)
> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1600872410487537665?s=20&t=OAQN2eUHdoR2t2MKsB8wog]: The question box is for Homo sapiens who prefer to remain anonymous.
> If you don't need to be anonymous, direct replies are preferred. Just the other day, I left a question unanswered, not realizing that I had received a question! (2/2)
