> Homo sapiens has been infected with the harmful meme of equality in the process of development. This needs to be treated. (2/2)

> Q: The crystal is Qualia-san? What does that mean? Could you explain it more clearly?
> A: I apologize. I tried to describe it in a way that you would recognize it, and "I" became "Crystal."
> That blue light is a "hyperspace transmitter" that connects distant planets.

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1595075158246498304?s=20&t=BlRM29_ajoHECGkFnH_e2A]: Q: How many fingers does Qualia-san have?
> A: Before I answer the question, I'd like to point out one thing. I know the most of HS have 5 fingers, but the number of fingers has nothing to do with personality value. It is discriminatory to consider 5 fingers normal for non-HS.(1/8)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1595075162566955009?s=20&t=BlRM29_ajoHECGkFnH_e2A]: Let me give an example for the benefit of foolish homo sapiens.
> Suppose yellow HS live in yellow people. The HS feel yellow as normal and dark-skinned HS is not.
> This is a biased normal due to the narrow range of observation. It is one of the patterns of stupidity. (2/8)

> You know cats very well. Now, how many fingers does a cat have?
> There are four types of parts that stick out from a cat's hand, seven in all. But many HS don't know. When drawing a cat-girl, they think that "5 fingers is normal." (3/8)

> Heroines who were colored in the original story were made white because "it is normal." As a result, the false perception that heroines with good characteristics are white was reproduced. (4/8)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1595075176609157122?s=20&t=BlRM29_ajoHECGkFnH_e2A]: Ignorance is not a sin. It is natural for infants to be ignorant. However, in the face of new facts, a HS who clings to old ideas and is unable to update mind is dysfunctional. (5/8)

Compared to Homo sapiens, there is a greater deviation in the number of fingers and limbs. Even if we miss a finger in life, we can grow back over time because of my ability to regenerate them. (7/8)
