> Countless girls have contracted with incubators, had their hopes fulfilled, and then given themselves over to despair." (cont.)

> Some of them brought about a turning point in history and led society to a new stage." In this story, the contact subject seems to be limited to a girl.

No, wait, is it possible that an alien civilization that does not like to leave traces of contact in history is selectively contacting women whose names are difficult to leave in history?

This in itself may have been fostered by extraterrestrial civilizations that want to hide traces of contact.

> Q. Does Qualia-san have free will? And what is your reason (basis) for thinking so?
> A. Hard question...(cont.)

> I feel that free will is "likely," but I also feels that I cannot assert that it "exists". This is because I cannot provide any evidence that it exists. On the other hand, I would confidently "act as if" there is free will.

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1588727804811956225?s=20&t=f_JWSZOhC1PG-TA7Z3-XEg]: For the sake of simplicity, let's narrow down the options for free will-based actions to two: A "to act as if I have free will" and B "to act as if I do not have free will."
> I will act as if I have free will (A).

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1588728096706170881?s=20&t=f_JWSZOhC1PG-TA7Z3-XEg]: If that is my mistake, free will does not exist, and the outcome is determined regardless of my will, then the outcome is the same whether I choose A or B, so there is no loss either way. If free will exists, then choosing B is foolish. Therefore, it is better to choose A.
