> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1615682574462111746?s=20&t=d1P1BFf3fFZnsz3HHIue7A]: I discovered that one of my fans has been saying behind my back that I look like an old fashioned male Homo sapiens. This is interesting. I am going to question him a bit to get some more information out of him. (1/10)

> He is assuming that "women know less than he does" and sometimes giving explanations to those who know more than he does.
> This is called mansplaining, and is considered a nuisance.(2/10)

> HS: When the woman already knows X, and the man teaches her X, there is no benefit to the woman, but a demerit because it takes time away from her.(3/10)

If she did, then the man is stupid for sharing information to no avail. If she didn't share the information, then the woman is stupid for assuming that others knows her inside.(4/10)

> HS: Oh, I was imagining verbal voice communication.(5/10)

The root of this problem is not one of two people, but time-bound voice communication, right?(6/10)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1615682594548633600?s=20&t=d1P1BFf3fFZnsz3HHIue7A]: While the concept of mansplaining is interesting, there are two problems with considering it similar to Qualia-san's actions.(7/10)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1615682598289936385?s=20&t=d1P1BFf3fFZnsz3HHIue7A]: Qualia-san is not speaking to one specific HS, but to a large number of people. This information sharing is valuable if there is HS in the crowd who benefits from the information. The fact that HS in the crowd already knows the information is not a reason not to share it.(8/10)

Those who already know the information or are not interested can skip reading it. The recipient can filter the information by oneself.(9/10)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1615682606422720514?s=20&t=d1P1BFf3fFZnsz3HHIue7A]: The act of interfering with the sender to stop sending out information is more disadvantageous than the disadvantage of sending it out.(10/10)
