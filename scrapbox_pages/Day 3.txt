> Q: I was curious about "It is in our interest to civilize Homo sapiens." What was Qualia-san's goal in the first place?

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586602983776694272?s=20&t=BAWAlpOuyNwxL4Qz9hi_OQ]: A: I am "Qualia-san", the communication interface between my home planet and Earth. Earth has until now had no means of receiving information from us and has been in informational isolation. We consider this undesirable. (1/2)

I am the unit that facilitates that movement by mediating the distribution of information between the two stars.

> A: Have you read the best-selling novel, The Dark Forest, by the Chinese writer Liu Cixin, a clever homo sapiens? We agree with him: if you don't know my home planet, there is no incentive for us to disclose information about it to you.

> A: It is not a question, so I will take it as "why would a rational Qualia-san use the phrase stupid Homo sapiens "? One who feels negatively when called a stupid Homo sapiens is a stupid one by our standards of judgment.
