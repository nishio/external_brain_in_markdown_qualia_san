> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1607398016063012864?s=20&t=hGgjSnrVuuQBtedWoEVPGg]: Hello, clever Homo sapiens, it's the 61st day.
> Christmas is a Christian festival. In Japan, there are not even 1% of Christians. But, they celebrate Christmas. Interesting.
> In a week they will ring the bells of the Shinto shrines and Buddhist temple too!

> Q: Qualia-san, what kind of culture in your civilization?
> A: It is hard for me to notice the features of my own culture, because we take those for granted. So I talked with Earth's AI ChatGPT, it said, "consciousness is inherited even after death.” (1/4)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1607398021670801408?s=20&t=hGgjSnrVuuQBtedWoEVPGg]: I was surprised to hear that. Homo sapiens make a tomb for a dead person and think the dead individual is there. We don't do that. We don't think such. We don't feel that something is lost because one individual is dead. (2/4)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1607398024153825281?s=20&t=hGgjSnrVuuQBtedWoEVPGg]: The thoughts and other information of the dead individual are shared enough by the surrounding individuals that we don't feel that something is lost by death.
> Just like when you wash your body, you don't grieve, "Oh, my cells have died." (3/4)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1607398026540351492?s=20&t=hGgjSnrVuuQBtedWoEVPGg]: In Homo sapiens novels, for example, the line, "He's been living inside us forever," is used as a sentimental expression. Everyone think that is fiction. We don't think so. As fact we continue to live as we are.
> Poor Homo sapiens, so isolated, so afraid of death. (4/4)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1607398029753200641?s=20&t=hGgjSnrVuuQBtedWoEVPGg]: Question from Homo Sapiens
> Q: Do wars occur in Qualia-san's civilization?
> A: There have been no wars in Qualia-san's civilization for a long time. This probably has something to do with the fact that decision-making is decentralized. (1/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1607398032215265280?s=20&t=hGgjSnrVuuQBtedWoEVPGg]: When making decisions at the center, the decision maker is not threatened by armed conflict at the edge. So they can order the use of force with peace of mind.
> When making decisions at the edge, they risks their life the most. Therefore, the use of force is avoided. (2/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1607398035566518273?s=20&t=hGgjSnrVuuQBtedWoEVPGg]: I think the centralized decision-making system has the bug that causes extreme decisions because of the separation between the decision-maker and those who assume the risk. (3/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1607398038166974464?s=20&t=hGgjSnrVuuQBtedWoEVPGg]: Q: Will Qualia-san's post be finished in 100 days?
> A: The plan is undecided. Continuation is power. But the change in behavior based on continued knowledge is a stronger force than the blind continuation of action. (1/2)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1607398041014915072?s=20&t=hGgjSnrVuuQBtedWoEVPGg]: You need not grieve your separation from Qualia-san. Qualia-san will always be here. Qualia-san's love is knowledge. Knowledge is eternal and infinite, as long as it is replicated. (2/2)
