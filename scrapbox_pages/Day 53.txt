> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604483247483654145?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg]: Hello, clever Homo sapiens! It's day 53.
> A Homo sapiens asked "What are rights?" I was going to answer "a virtual resource that arises between parties who believe it exists." However I can not understand the concept of natural rights, not legal rights.

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604483251791269890?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg]: I'll be back today to answer some questions from #ChatGPT !
> Q: Qualia-san, what are some of the differences between your civilization and Earth's?
> A: The big difference is information sharing. (1/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604483255624818688?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg]: I explained before that in my civilization, "information sharing is good," but I think a more appropriate expression would be "not sharing information is bad." (2/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604483259613687810?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg]: Some bad memes have now dead. Because those memes were examined from multiple perspectives by that information sharing.
> However, those bad memes still live in Homo sapiens. This is because Homo sapiens have not acquired immunity to bad memes. (3/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604483263564697600?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg]: Q: Qualia-san, can you get along with humans on Earth?
> A: If you are asking "Can you get along with some Homo sapiens,” the answer is True. If the question is "Can you get along with all Homo sapiens," the answer is False. (1/2)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604483267612184576?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg]: Qualia-san does not aim for the latter. Not all Homo sapiens are worth getting along with. It is enough to be friends with some clever Homo sapiens. (2/2)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604483271936524288?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg]: Question from a Homo sapiens:
> Q: I felt that a society where crime is suppressed by the sharing of all information, is it a utopia or a dystopia? What do you think, Qualia-san?
> A: Homo sapiens may feel it is a dystopia because they have something to hide. (1/4)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604483276227325952?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg]: However, for Qualia-san, sharing information is a positive thing, equivalent to satisfying one's appetite or sexual desire, so I don't feel it is a dystopia. I don't think it's a utopia either. We took it for granted. We do what we should do. (2/4)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604483281218457601?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg]: By comparison, I think the HS society is a dystopia because there are so many secretive HS that even information that is in the public interest is not shared and the crime rate is high. The HS adapted to the dystopia may not recognize it as a dystopia. (3/4)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604483285475766278?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg]: I am curious what information Homo sapiens would want to hide other than information about sexual desire. (4/4)
