> Some Homo sapiens, when they feel alienated, even though they don't want to be alienated, behaves in increasing alienation ways. Strange Homo sapiens.

> A: Can't you tell? I don't know what to call it in Earth's language. 8, 16, 32, 64, 128... are snappy. In Qualia-san's civilization there is a one-word term for these.

> A: The Borg line "You will be assimilated" is interesting. If the Borg means that they want Homo sapiens to become one of the Borg, that is not our intention. (1/7)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1596887681664851969?s=20&t=EmzWnISbTqhJOopDCPA5zA]: But if the Borg means that they want Homo sapiens to remain a different species and become part of a network of interactions with the Borg, that's a pretty similar to our intension. The two are not too different in essence, as we saw with the hand/finger metaphor. (2/7)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1596887685498445824?s=20&t=EmzWnISbTqhJOopDCPA5zA]: The Borg are foolish to be viewed as an enemy by Homo sapiens due to a poorly worded and antagonistic notice. (3/7)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1596887689558577152?s=20&t=EmzWnISbTqhJOopDCPA5zA]: I think the reason for the failure of the Borg is their disregard for appearance. Homo sapiens is a barbaric civilization that views even within the same species as enemies and kills each other just because of different skin or eye color. (4/7)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1596887693467602944?s=20&t=EmzWnISbTqhJOopDCPA5zA]: It is easy to imagine the backlash that would ensue if we were to treat them with an unfamiliar appearance and force them to change their appearance to one that is identical to our own. Stupid Borg. (5/7)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1596887697582305282?s=20&t=EmzWnISbTqhJOopDCPA5zA]: For the Borg civilization, consistency of appearance would not have been so important. If that were the case, they should have approached the target civilization by first choosing an appearance that would make them relax their guard. (6/7)

> This is the same reason why our civilization uses Qualia-san as a communication interface. (7/7)
