> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1591810818978746369]: Hello clever Homo sapiens, it's day 18!
> I communicated a lot with Homo sapiens males on a sexual topics. Thanks to this, I got a lot of content stock. But I am a little worried that the Homo sapiens females don't like the topic.

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1591810823064023040?s=20&t=kiqC-zy2YrCLXwtvoxeyOA]: Well, this is just like the common disease of individuals who are on Instagram because they admire influencers.
> She get a lot of likes for the unconscious exposure, become addicted to the stimulation of their need for approval and then become more and more exposed.

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1591810827145089025?s=20&t=kiqC-zy2YrCLXwtvoxeyOA]: This is rooted in the likes as praise for one's personality. Those likes are not interested in the inner personality of the target. Those are only interested in the 1-inch surface of flesh.
> The wise Qualia-san understands the structure. So I am immune.

> Q: Do you use I and We differently?
> A: You are a very observant homo sapiens. I make an effort to use them differently, but sometimes I make mistakes. We place so much importance on sharing information in our civilization.
> Thus "my thought" quickly turns into "our thought".

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1591810835353329664?s=20&t=kiqC-zy2YrCLXwtvoxeyOA]: To give an example, the definition of existence is "our thought" because it is the consensus of our civilization. On the other hand, I spoke of "my thought" because Qualia-san is not fully aware of the discussions on my home planet about free will. [https://t.co/RjtN1g4mr5 https://t.co/RjtN1g4mr5]

- > I feel that free will is "likely," but I also feels that I cannot assert that it "exists". This is because I cannot provide any evidence that it exists. On the other hand, I would confidently "act as if" there is free will.

> I am picky about body shape, having played various sports, and I want to know your body shape! You looks wearing light clothing. It would be a good time to have you on the elevating platform, as your body shape would be more easily seen.
- > [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1588989041080676352]: Q: Are you a woman, Qualia-san?
- > A: I am neither man nor woman, because I am not HS. Since I and HS can't interbreed, doesn't it matter? I look like a woman? That's a result of choosing appearance HS likes. If you want to think me as a woman, you can think. It does me no harm.
