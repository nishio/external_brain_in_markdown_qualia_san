If my words fall on a wise homo sapiens, it will sprouts, it will grow, and it will be worth hundreds of times more. Those who have ears, listen, learn, and think. It will bring you fruit.

> Q: A senior in college keeps saying things like "Ruby is old!" What do you think about this, Qualia-san?
> A: It is really interesting how stupid homo sapiens behave, using a natural language that is many times older and saying "old" to a much newer language.

> When intellectual capacity is low, behavior approaches randomness. So the probability of getting odd behavior increases. Just as Homo sapiens find deformed cats amusing, your odd behavior has some value.

Besides the easily recognizable ear deformities, it is said that joint disease can also cause pain and disability. Homo sapiens are trying to make it less painful, at least these days. Gentle Homo sapiens!

Please keep up the good work. See you soon! Bye! Bye!
