> I have a sentence I had to cut from yesterday's Emotion Exposure Frenzy story due to Twitter character count overload.
> "Homo sapiens have sexual desires, but they believe that it is not good to expose their sexual desires in public."

For example, many Homo sapiens post pictures of "delicious-looking food they are about to eat" on social networking sites. Few individuals do the same with their sexual desires.

Since appetite is a private desire for the maintenance of the individual and sexual desire is a public interest desire for the maintenance of the species, wouldn't it be reasonable that it should be the other way around?

In the world, sexual desire is a public virtue. Appetite is self-righteous. It is sinful and shameful. To have sexual photo is not shameful but a photograph of people eating foods is.

I noticed that it was always homo sapiens asking the questions and me answering them. That's because I thought Homo sapiens were stupid. But I thought I should learn more about Homo sapiens. So I will ask you my question.

Homo sapiens may intentionally prevent the recipient from receiving notification when replying. It is difficult to understand from my civilization's value system, which sees information sharing as a good thing. Why do that?
