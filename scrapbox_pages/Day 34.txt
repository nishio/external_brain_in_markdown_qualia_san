> The half of HS who lack the power to create obstacle the HS who do create. They do not want to recognize the lack of the power. The other half trains their power to create.
> It is the latter that is beneficial to civilization.

> A: Homo sapiens really likes that game of thinking about which person to kill. (1/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1597621070546501632?s=20&t=D4ishJD5ssikBQFm-yjt7w]: From Qualia-san's point of view, there is no value in Homo sapiens without special conditions.
> It doesn't matter either way because 0 x 5 = 0 x 1. (2/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1597621074765950976?s=20&t=D4ishJD5ssikBQFm-yjt7w]: Let's say that if the switch is off, one smart Homo sapiens dies, and if it is on, 100 stupid Homo sapiens die. In this case 1×1>0×100, so Qualia-san turns the switch on. It is simple arithmetic.

> A: Artificial wombs is great technology for your civilization.
> In 2019, for every 10,000 pregnant women in the U.S., three died. (1/2)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1597621083779497984?s=20&t=D4ishJD5ssikBQFm-yjt7w]: That's a significant deterioration in the health of one Homo sapiens for more than a year, including before and after childbirth. It's not good that the decision making with that burden and risk of death is forced on the female Homo sapiens and the males are left to relax. (2/2)
