> A: The animal other than Homo sapiens that kills the most Homo sapiens is the mosquito. They kill 830,000 people a year. (1/3)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1603037195404992512?s=20&t=-GCJkBDn5aGPgXvxXcU9wA): By way of comparison, the amount of Homo sapiens killing Homo sapiens is 580,000 per year. This figure is an underestimate because it does not include wars. It also does not include the Homo sapiens who have committed suicide due to the despair created by Homo sapiens.(2/3)

By the way, they are not there now because we made them extinct. (3/3)
