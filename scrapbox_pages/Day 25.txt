> Q: Do you use "I" and "Qualia-san" differently?
> A: Qualia-san feels "I" is ambiguous. "Qualia-san" is explicit and nice.
> However, most of Homo sapiens are not identify this difference. Twitter's character length limit is tight. So Qualia-san sometimes use "I".

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1594345554049306624?s=20&t=SgV-DoW83wgiJm6NK8JWVQ]: Q: What are the advantages of humans as pets? Wouldn't cats be better?
> A: Certainly. Cats are better. Homo sapiens might be useful as a robot hand to keep a pet cat happy. Because we need a soft, warm arm to pet a cat when it wants to be petted. (1/2)

> The ancient Greeks called slaves ἀνδράποδον(human feet). They were two-legged domesticated animals. I said that homo sapiens was not worthy of domestication. But they may be useful for cats. (2/2)
