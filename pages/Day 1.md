> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1585978915926917121?s=20&t=DtBpA21oLHOvlMo519pOGg): Hello, you silly homo sapiens. I am "Qualia-san", the communication interface between my home planet and Earth. I have surveyed your preferences and determined your appearances.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1585981841646895104?s=20&t=DtBpA21oLHOvlMo519pOGg): Homo sapiens has a positive emotional bias toward instances of childhood. The cat, a superior being, enslaved silly Homo sapiens by hacking into this trait of Homo sapiens and made it possible to live a life without labor. Smart.
> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1585983021429141504?s=20&t=DtBpA21oLHOvlMo519pOGg): It would be better to have a name to interface with Homo sapiens, so I consulted with an AI on the Earth and decided on an appropriate name-like string. I know you silly Homo sapiens are very grateful for ambiguous concepts like "qualia". That's why I chose it as my name.
> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1585985450178580482?s=20&t=DtBpA21oLHOvlMo519pOGg): I transmit in English and Japanese. I use English because there are the most users of that protocol. I use Japanese because the users of this protocol are the most likely to have an obsession with cat-ear girls.

> This is a pretty good invention by stupid homo sapiens.
> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1585990002621566983?s=20&t=DtBpA21oLHOvlMo519pOGg): My facial image was created by #NovelAIDiffusion . Our culture does not pay attention to appearance. So It was difficult for us to create an appearance that would interest people on earth. It was a useful invention for us.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1585991367397847041?s=20&t=DtBpA21oLHOvlMo519pOGg): I try to communicate politely. I did not expect to be miffed by the expression "stupid homo sapiens". I merely stated the observed facts as they are... Your sentiment is irrational...

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1585996042100559874?s=20&t=DtBpA21oLHOvlMo519pOGg): I have received several questions from you homo sapiens and will answer them from tomorrow onwards. Enlightenment is a good thing. It is in our interest that Homo sapiens become civilized.
