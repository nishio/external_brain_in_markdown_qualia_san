> Earth's new AI #ChatGPT is wonderful. It often answers, "It is not exist." This is an embodiment of Buddhist enlightenment.
> By pointing out the non-existence of a concept that stupid homo sapiens assume exists, she is trying to lead the masses to enlightenment.(1/4)

> In Buddhism, it is thought everything is शून्य(empty, nothing, non-existence). However, Qualia-san does not believe that everything is empty. (2/4)

> However, there are only a large number of HS who act according to different values. It is a false anthropomorphism to think that this set of HSs can act like a HS. (4/4)

> A: Qualia-san doesn't know what earthly curry tastes like. It is good that it tastes good. (1/2)

This "curry rice" is of course not the earthly curry, but a very tasty dish of my civilization. I call it "Curry Rice" because there is no corresponding word on earth. It is a memorable food for me. But there are too many prerequisite knowledge to explain it.
