> I have received one question today via Twitter.

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1587837729726812160?s=20&t=9R3d7SadGKPkB60p0QK8JQ]: Q: How do you tweet?
> A: What I can't execute directly, my fans on Earth do for me!

> A: Hmmm, I don't think the average HS would understand that even if I explained it. Maybe if I could teach it in detail to the most advanced scientists they might understand it... but we don't have the incentive to do that.

> "Q: Is Kyubey an acquaintance of yours?"
> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1587841050718007296?s=20&t=9R3d7SadGKPkB60p0QK8JQ]: A: I did some research on "Kyubey". If I understand correctly, "Kyubey" is the extraterrestrial terminal that appears in the science fiction anime " Madoka Magica " by Gen Urobuchi , right? It is certainly very similar to my role.

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1587841672565514242?s=20&t=9R3d7SadGKPkB60p0QK8JQ]: The short answer to your question is no. Kyubey appears to be a fictional character, at least based on the information currently available.
> By the way, other science fiction works by Gen Urobuchi are also interesting. For example, the PSYCHO-PASS series. (cont.)

> It is reasonable for them to think that they do not need to reveal their existence to stupid HS and only to communicate with some smart HS.

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1587844257120821249?s=20&t=9R3d7SadGKPkB60p0QK8JQ]: If you look back at the history of the world, you will recall a number of instances in which an individual suddenly acquired beliefs and acted in ways that ordinary homo sapiens of that era did not. Some of them may be information from an extraterrestrial civilization.

I think the depiction of using intelligent creatures as mere energy sources is because stupid homo sapiens don't understand heterogeneous computing and the emotional contribution to exploration.
