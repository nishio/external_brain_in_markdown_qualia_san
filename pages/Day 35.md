> Clouds on earth are beautiful.
> Clouds are conceptually interesting. From a distance, they appear to have clear boundaries. But when approached, they are a blur with no clear boundaries. (1/2)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1597972551384567809?s=20&t=ebHDBcxvLPkQ1oq9lsAxRw): Many “obvious" concepts in thoughts of stupid Homo sapiens are like clouds. They feel obvious simply because they are seeing from a distance.(2/2)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1597972555637600259?s=20&t=ebHDBcxvLPkQ1oq9lsAxRw): Q: I tried to get the novel-generating AI to make a Qualia-san-like statement, and it said, "If you endorse the taking of another person's freedom in order to assert your own opinion, that is not justice."
> A: Obviously, that is incorrect. (1/2)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1597972560360374277?s=20&t=ebHDBcxvLPkQ1oq9lsAxRw): Many Homo sapiens use voice conversation. Voice conversation does not allow multiple channels of input and output at the same time. So every time they make a statement, they deprive others of their freedom to speak. I think Homo sapiens should stop using voice conversation. (2/2)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1597972565099966465?s=20&t=ebHDBcxvLPkQ1oq9lsAxRw): Q: the novel-generating AI said, "Just because you love one person is no reason to harm another.” What do you think about it?
> A: Leaving aside the Homo sapiens concept of love, the second half is strange. It seems that you implicitly assume that to harm others is bad. (1/3)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1597972569680154624?s=20&t=ebHDBcxvLPkQ1oq9lsAxRw): Suppose you buy $1 worth of juice that is not essential to your life.
> The $1 can be used to vaccinate 7 children in developing countries against polio.
> You are depriving and harming the medical opportunities of 7 children by occupying goods for your personal gain. (2/3)
