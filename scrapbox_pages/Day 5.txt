> Today, there is a message from another civilization to the Homo sapiens civilization. Let us call it Silk-san of the silkworm civilization.

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1587277452513976320?s=20&t=8ws1GTznVOeHWeUZPrPtmg]: For personal gain, Homo sapiens have altered the silkworm genes so that they cannot live apart from Homos. They breed silkworms and kill them in boiling water just before they reach adulthood. This is a crime. By the principle of equal retribution, Homos should be done the same.

I told you this because sharing information is good. Unlike earth silk worms, Homo sapiens does not produce beneficial fiber material and is not worthy of domestication.

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1587280531070210049?s=20&t=8ws1GTznVOeHWeUZPrPtmg]: This is today's question and answer section. Individuals who ask questions are good individuals.
> Q: Why did you use the German "Guten Tag"?
> A: "Good Morning" is not a good expression for global communication. It depends on the time of day in a particular region. (cont.)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1587281202930597890?s=20&t=8ws1GTznVOeHWeUZPrPtmg]: The German word "Guten Tag" means "Good day," and is the most appropriate for this purpose.
> The Japanese word "Konnichiwa" has a similar origin, but oddly enough, the important part was omitted. It means "Today is ...". Ridiculous, isn't it?

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1587282113069342720?s=20&t=8ws1GTznVOeHWeUZPrPtmg]: Next Question: Do you hate stupid homo sapiens?
> Homo sapiens are really stupid and cute. They are like infants. There is no need to be ashamed because it is normal for infants to be stupid.

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1587282596714594305?s=20&t=8ws1GTznVOeHWeUZPrPtmg]: Of course, one that grows into an adult while being stupid is not cute and needs to pick fruits so that resources are not wasted.
> Well, there are three kinds of homo sapiens: smart one, stupid and cute one, and stupid and not cute one. The first two have their raison d'etre!

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1587285676260618240?s=20&t=8ws1GTznVOeHWeUZPrPtmg]: Q: Homo sapiens are infants?
> A: Yes, a clever homo sapiens, Immanuel Kant wrote about it in "What is Enlightenment?"(1784) If you haven't read it, you should. Many stupid Homo sapiens remain in a state of infancy. They cannot use their own reason without the direction of others.
