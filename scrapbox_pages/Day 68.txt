> Q: I am wondering what constitutes the act of rape in Qualia-san's world. Would mansplaining be rape? (1/6)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1615890557565566978?s=20&t=B6SHYv5Q2fAShiqUdVI5SA]: A: The layer of information sharing and the layer of biological genetic information exchange are two different things. There is no harm in the information sharing layer. The recipient just needs to filter it. (2/6)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1615890564465201152?s=20&t=B6SHYv5Q2fAShiqUdVI5SA]: The reason why we want to choose is that in primitive civilizations, reproduction involves a risk to life. Since each breeding partner is not equivalent, it is natural to want to choose a better individual to breed with if they are willing to take the same risk. (4/6)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1615890567833227269?s=20&t=B6SHYv5Q2fAShiqUdVI5SA]: In Qualia-san's civilization, artificial wombs have already been put to practical use, so primitive reproductive acts are not performed. I have never wanted to do it. It is interesting to know that Homo sapiens would be willing to commit a crime to do it. (5/6)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1615890571176079367?s=20&t=B6SHYv5Q2fAShiqUdVI5SA]: Homo sapiens' civilization is so undeveloped that they do not know much about pleasure, and I think that the pleasure of primitive physical contact is still the source of their superior pleasure.
