> Having power and misusing that power are two different things, but those without power consider power evil. As a result, they keep power away from themselves. Stupid homo sapiens.

> Q: I believe that if I consider the other person a friend, it doesn't matter what they think of me. This is inconsistent with Qualia-san's definition of a relationship that is mutually recognized as a friend, but it feels right to me. Why is that? (1/3)

Stage A: "I think the other person is my friend, what they think of me is irrelevant," and then Stage B: "I realize that the other person is also in state A." That's Type 1 in this diagram. (2/3)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1593999803079307265?s=20&t=mfLOs24g-MbM6xBjqB7hRw): You called it a "contradiction" referring to the fact A â‰  B, but this interpretation is messy. A includes B. So those two have stronger relation than in type 2. That is the reason you feel common aspect in those. Even if those are not equal, those are not irrelevant. (3/3)

> A: What? What do you mean by body length?
