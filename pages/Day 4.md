> I am here to establish friendly relations with you. That you are stupid is nothing to be ashamed of. It is natural and funny that infants are stupid compared to adults, because they are infants. And we are looking forward to your growth.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586918091170029568?s=20&t=1PkjxljcQ-krAEJvZNE0PQ): Q.Where was the Twitter header image taken? I was curious because it is a sight that is not easily seen on earth.
> A:You noticed I changed the cover, great. On my home planet, there is an organization like NASA on Earth that ...

Maybe there was a detailed explanation on that page, but I closed it without bookmarking it, so I am not sure.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586919147857813504?s=20&t=1PkjxljcQ-krAEJvZNE0PQ): Q. Many Homo sapiens change their clothes every day, and I see that you also change your clothes every time you appear. Is this because you are trying to conform to the customs of Homo sapiens?
> A: No, I just don't see the value in being consistent in my attire. (cont.)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586919598510596097?s=20&t=1PkjxljcQ-krAEJvZNE0PQ): I am "Qualia-san", the communication interface between my home planet and Earth. Clothing does not significantly affect communication. (cont.)
> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586920060949389312?s=20&t=1PkjxljcQ-krAEJvZNE0PQ): Of course, we are aware that the lack of clothing or the type of clothing can affect the content of communication. In general, there seems to be a noticeable change in the direction of male Homo sapiens becoming dumber.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586920797586612224?s=20&t=1PkjxljcQ-krAEJvZNE0PQ): Q: Is Qualia-san an enemy of mankind? Is she an ally?
> A: Of course we are not your enemy. To use a simple analogy, we are doctors. We think it is good to cure the diseases of the Homo sapiens civilization. Some young Homo sapiens may be afraid of doctors. That is foolish.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586921547305992194?s=20&t=1PkjxljcQ-krAEJvZNE0PQ): To be more specific, for example, a dentist will apply a patch to a damaged tooth. For severe dysfunctions that cannot be corrected with a patch, the tooth is removed or an artificial tooth is implanted. (cont.)
> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586922115202048000?s=20&t=1PkjxljcQ-krAEJvZNE0PQ): If you have a malignant neoplasm (or is it easier to understand this by calling it cancer?) in your body, doctors may administer radiation or chemicals to keep it from growing. Or it can be resected.
> Part of our mission is to do this same thing to Homo sapiens civilization.
