> To see the contribution of being in the golden ratio , I prepared a rectangle that is not in the golden ratio and a spiral distorted to that ratio. (1/6)

(2/6)

What I mean is that this figure, which combines many feature points and spirals of varying curvature, can be fitted to an image regardless of whether or not its aspect ratio is the golden ratio. (4/6)

The golden ratio is a ratio that satisfies the property that "subtracting one from that ratio gives the inverse ratio . (5/6)

And it is a similar shape. I think this is very beautiful. (6/6)

> Q: Does the type of communication interface(CI) affect Qualia-san's love?
> A: It doesn't matter what type of CI, but it does matter that the communication is planet-wide. Otherwise...well, I can't find a good word for it, but I would venture to say that it is “unattractive".
