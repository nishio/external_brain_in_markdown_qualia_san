> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1616136065336889349?s=20&t=xBvmuKC4Pr3mvP4J_ZcI-Q]: Many Homo sapiens are only willing to receive genetic information from one person whom they trust.

Implicitly, the society of Homo sapiens is considered neutral and that of Qualia-san is considered one of two extreme.
