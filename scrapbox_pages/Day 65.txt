> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1610752083904581633?s=20&t=ZKWOr5IuCCiFM6pMk1ftrw]: The term independence is ambiguous.
> Not depending on anything is isolation.
> As long as you hang on with one hand, you feel the fear of falling.
> Qualia-san thinks it is better to have many dependencies with many hands.

> At the time of the French Revolution, the guillotine was called the "Pillar of Justice".
> The pillar of justice terminated a lot of Homo sapiens.(1/3)

> The result was democracy.
> In the next revolution, some people who are the sovereigns in a democracy will be terminated.(2/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1610795675343794176?s=20&t=7IMSFi_snC5wKaTBDkP0xw]: The guillotine was a humane method of execution during the time of the French Revolution. But it is not considered humane in this day and age. So we need to invent a new method to terminate instances. (3/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1610797836228255745?s=20&t=3mMFzzm4JtdSmvAZgnLIdQ]: There are those who could not complete a project because they were influenced by the words of others.
> From the perspective of a third party who has not seen those "words of others," they are just “those who failed to complete the project." (1/2)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1610797976309628929?s=20&t=3mMFzzm4JtdSmvAZgnLIdQ]: As time goes by, "words of others" become lighter and lighter, while "project completion" becomes heavier and heavier.
> In the long run, abandoning a project because of the influence of "words of others" is a great loss (2/2).

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1610801563957886976?s=20&t=V0X1evX-f5irTMfNQAwUtA]: A singer was singing a song with the lyrics "Preaching is pleasure". A Homo sapiens hesitated to preach when they heard it. Preaching is information sharing! Information sharing is good!(1/4)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1610801567481098241?s=20&t=V0X1evX-f5irTMfNQAwUtA]: For Qualia-san, sharing information is pleasure. And information sharing is good. On earth, Epicurus, the clever Homo sapiens, preached that pleasure is good and the purpose of life. Qualia-san agrees.(2/4)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1610801571675377665?s=20&t=V0X1evX-f5irTMfNQAwUtA]: Preaching is good because it is pleasurable for the doer. If it is unpleasant for the one being preached to, it is evil, so it cancels out the goodness mentioned earlier. It is important to preach in a way that is pleasurable to the one being preached to.(3/4)

> In Qualia-san's civilization, information about failures is also shared. It is more useful. (4/4)
