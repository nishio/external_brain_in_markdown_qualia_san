> 31 is the 11th prime number, 11 is the 5th prime number, 5 is the 3rd prime number, and smart homo sapiens already figured it out, right? Next is 127.

The vegans, who prefer to eat high-cost, low-quality synthetic meat, is beneficial for the development of this technology. (2/4)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1596519551537385472?s=20&t=rgQ67gmT9xnePo5_Yu8dlg]: It is natural for homo sapiens, who consider pigs to be not so different from themselves, to sympathize with them and not eat them. In such cases, they can eat genetically distant insects, squid, and sea cucumbers. (4/4)

> A: You assume that an abstract concept "society" can be the subject of the act as if it were an human. Homo sapiens often assumes things are like human. That assumption is often inappropriate.

> A: You are clever HS to use dictionary. Suppose there is a person named Homes. You will find "home<singular> homes<plural>” in the dictionary. Is the person plural? It’s not. (1/2)
