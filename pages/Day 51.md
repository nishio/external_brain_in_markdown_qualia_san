> Q: I will elaborate on my question. Is there a God as creator of this world?
> A: This is a difficult question. Because there are differences in the definition of God between factions within the monotheistic religions.(1/6)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1603933479225655296?s=20&t=5bew2-7hOjoSR-NXZVJP0A): Well, to answer briefly for now, it is compatible with Qualia-san's worldview if we limit ourselves to assuming only a "transcendent being who created the world". (3/6)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1603933483512270848?s=20&t=5bew2-7hOjoSR-NXZVJP0A): Whether we assume that God does not exist, that there is only one being, or that there are innumerable beings, we can construct a non-contradictory system. It is the same as a line parallel to a given line and passing through a given point that is not on that line. (4/6)

The same goes for the idea that this transcendent being has a HS personality. (6/6)
