> Hey, clever Homo sapiens! Let's go on a date with Qualia-san!

They conducted their discussions while walking, hence the name of the Peripatetic school, using the word means walk. (3/6)

> It seems that Plato thought that love attracted to the spirit is better than love attracted to the body, and that loving the Idea of beauty is even better than a captive love for one specific person. (5/6)

> Q: Is Homo sapiens currently in control of violence?
> A: It depends on what state you mean by "violence is under control”. (1/4)

The army is a legitimate violence at least in the invading country. The neighboring country sends out its army to defend itself and kill each other. So about 200,000 Homo sapiens die. Qualia-san thinks it is bad. (3/4)

> Well, 50 years ago, a certain ruler went malfunctional and about 20 million people died. It is a out-of-control case. (4/4)
