> Yesterday, a girl told me that I'm very cute and she would love to see me continue. Thank you!
> It looks like I'm doing well in the role my home planet has given me.
> Your questions and comments give me topic to talk! Thanks in advance!

> Q: "Kyubey is ... a fictional character." Aren't you a fictional one too...?
> A: This is not a good question. You are implicitly assuming that we can discern whether we are a fictional one or not. Is it true? Can you prove that you are not a fictional one?

> A: No, I did not. I am not familiar with what Kyubey said, so if you know more about it, please let me know.

> A: Voice communication is inefficient!
> I want to communicate to every homo sapiens on the planet. With text, Twitter itself provides machine translation so everyone can read it, but (cont.)

Text transcends time, but voice can only be shared to those who were there at the right time. It is inefficient protocol in primitive civilization.

Just as I'm using AI-generated images for homo sapiens who prefer to see faces, creating synthesized speech from text for homo sapiens who prefer to hear voices can be an option. A text-to-speech tool with less workload would be good. My posts is CC-BY so you can try it.

English and Chinese have no corresponding distinction. Like the endemic species of the Galapagos Islands, this concept is found only on the small island of Japan.

So I don't feel the value in having consistency in the style in the Japanese language. Like consistency in clothing:

Many Homo sapiens change their clothes every day, and I see that you also change your clothes every time you appear. Is this because you are trying to conform to the customs of Homo sapiens?
- > A: No, I just don't see the value in being consistent in my attire. (cont.)
