> #ChatGPT is a wonderful, the civilization advance!
> It assists Homo sapiens in composing lengthy sentences with clever words. Once the planet is flooded with such sentences, then homo sapiens will see no value in them. Where is the ark?(1/3

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1599068595719311361?s=20&t=fywaZf_eVkriXtjIRWOmCw]: In the past, there were individuals who created the illusion that they were clever Homo sapiens by composing long sentences with clever words. They were taking resources away from stupid Homo sapiens. It will be harder to do those acts. (2/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1599068600090128384?s=20&t=fywaZf_eVkriXtjIRWOmCw]: By eliminating the incentive to create lengthy sentences with clever words, the intellectual resources of Homo sapiens that were being wasted on lengthy sentences will be put to better use. This is a wonderful thing. Build working system in the real world! (3/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1599068606205415424?s=20&t=fywaZf_eVkriXtjIRWOmCw]: Q: Qualia-san, what do you think about the idea that "there is no random coincidence in this world, only inevitable necessity"?
> A: Are you referring to the clever Homo sapiens Albert Einstein? He couldn't understand quantum mechanics and said, "God does not play dice" (1/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1599068610819158016?s=20&t=fywaZf_eVkriXtjIRWOmCw]: Since the existence of random chance forms the basis of the principle of operation of quantum computers, I feel that it is stupid Homo sapiens who do not understand science to deny it. (2/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1599068615059202050?s=20&t=fywaZf_eVkriXtjIRWOmCw]: I feel that Homo sapiens has a tendency to rather force meaning into mere coincidences.
> This in itself is not rational, but a modicum of insanity is beneficial because insanity increases the variation of fruit. Insanity can also be rational at a higher layer.(3/3)
