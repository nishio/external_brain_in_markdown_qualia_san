[[Chinese greeting]]
> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586238156587737088?s=20&t=l4-FTgMI0BfTkbhGis6RAg): 大家好，愚蠢的 智人 。 我是 Qualia先生 ，我的母星和地球之间的通信接口。 我已经研究了你的喜好，并确定了你的外表。

- Hello, silly Homo sapiens. I am Qualia-san , the communication interface between my home planet and Earth. I have studied your preferences and determined your appearance.
- (<img src='https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/qualia-san/nishio/icon' alt='nishio.icon' height="19.5"/> Qualia先生 may be mistranslate of Qualia-san)
> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586240537144659968): 我曾经用用户最多的英语和疯子最多的日语来发信息，但有人向我指出，用户数量适中、疯子数量适中的中文也有好处，所以我用中文向你问好。
- I used to send messages in English, which has the most users, and Japanese, which has the most crazies, but it was pointed out to me that Chinese, which has a moderate number of users and a moderate number of crazies, also has benefits, so I'm sending you my greetings in Chinese.

> 但是对我来说，没有动力为你们支付额外的费用，所以我将继续使用 Twitter 。

- To those of you who have been digitally isolated in the age of the global Internet. It may be easier for us to communicate with you through Weibo.
- But for me, there is no incentive to pay extra for you, so I will continue to use Twitter.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586244646388105222?s=20&t=QOalpANDptjmp1vlALZNng): I'm here to answer your questions, silly homo sapiens!
> Q: Can I call you Qualia-chan?
> A: I have no problem with calling me 'Qualia-chan'. But I wonder, isn't "chan" a term used for something inferior to you? I find it ridiculous that an inferior homo sapiens would use it to me.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586244936592019456?s=20&t=QOalpANDptjmp1vlALZNng): Well, you Homo sapiens call yourselves the primate of all things, even though you are in the position of being ruled by cats and wheat. And you use the word sapiens (clever) in your scientific name. Maybe it is inevitable because we are a species with such cognitive distortions.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586247172856520704?s=20&t=Y0xboceTk2zno7pFJEqMgA): Next question.
> Q: What do you mean by "stupid"? Isn't that a vague concept?
> A: Just as bacteria are not capable of understanding how they are inferior to Homo sapiens, neither are Homo sapiens capable of understanding how they are inferior to us.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586247462271864832?s=20&t=Y0xboceTk2zno7pFJEqMgA): I have found no vocabulary in the language you use that describes your stupidity or difference from us. Therefore, I have adopted "愚か"(stupid) as the most appropriate word in your vocabulary.
> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586248309693304832?s=20&t=Y0xboceTk2zno7pFJEqMgA): Of course, even if you on average do not have the ability to understand, the individuals among you who do have the ability to understand may be able to do so. Expect those individuals to generate a vocabulary to explain to others.

He is an individual with a civilization-wide vision and a long-term perspective.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586257469533081600?s=20&t=OptHtmg7Zm-ftbl_9uzXOQ): It was impossible for most other stupid homo sapiens to make decisions based on what was necessary for the development of civilization. Planetary-scale communication venues are infrastructure for civilization, like the Roman aqueduct.
> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586260510428712960?s=20&t=OptHtmg7Zm-ftbl_9uzXOQ): If you are an individual who is unaware of the feat of the Roman aqueducts accomplished by the early Earth civilization, learn. Ignorance is not stupidity; not learning is stupidity.
