> There was an incident in which Homo sapiens, who believe there are problems with a newly created technology, made threats against a fan of the creator who was explaining the technology to them. (1/4)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1605225871458988032?s=20&t=zklOHOD2FXiZLnhSw5i8DA]: It is the "creation of new justice through violence" that I explained on Day 47. Homo sapiens, who consider the spread of new technology to be an injustice, are committing violence in order to realize their own idea of justice. (2/4)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1605225875435200512?s=20&t=zklOHOD2FXiZLnhSw5i8DA]: If the new justice they are trying to create is harmful to the progress of civilization, it can only be suppressed by stronger violence. This was explained on Day 48. (3/4)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1605225879533015040?s=20&t=zklOHOD2FXiZLnhSw5i8DA]: Some Homo sapiens think the violence is not good. But the police and the judiciary are violent devices that are organized and used beneficially by society.
> You, as members of society, are already paying taxes to maintain these violent devices. (4/4)

> Q: What is the social structure of Qualia-san's civilization?
> A: In a word, decentralized. Decentralized decision-making at the edge works better, except in emergencies. It is because centralized decision-making has transmission overhead.

> QS: If you think differently from those around you, you should share it.
> HS: We can be disadvantaged by that sharing. (1/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1605225891130265602?s=20&t=zklOHOD2FXiZLnhSw5i8DA]: QS: It is beneficial to society to share ideas that differ from those around the one. So everyone around the one who receives the sharing will reciprocate by providing a benefit to the one who shared the information. (2/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1605225895169363969?s=20&t=zklOHOD2FXiZLnhSw5i8DA]: If you act in a way that is detrimental to the one who shared the information, you will be disadvantaged in the long run because future information sharing will not take place. It is a stupid act. (3/3)
