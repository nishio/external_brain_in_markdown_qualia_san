> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1591134421427847169): Hello, Clever Homo Sapiens, it's Day 16! SQUARE NUMBERS! And so snappy!
> Some homo sapiens feel that the words of Qualia-san is a poisonous, but they are cognitively deranged. Poison and medicine are two sides of the same coin. ...

> If you feel that my words are poisonous, you should think whether you have become a germ for civilization.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1591135427666530307?s=20&t=rbz8WaTXGJxOT4FdWsVz5g): Q: You mentioned prime numbers on days 11 and 13...do you like prime numbers too, Qualia-san?
> A: Our research shows that some individuals in Homo sapiens show a strong interest in prime numbers, and these individuals tend to have a high affinity for Qualia-san's civilization.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1591137133187989504?s=20&t=rbz8WaTXGJxOT4FdWsVz5g): Q: What did you mean when you said "I am a smart homo sapiens" in your greeting yesterday?
> A: This was a mistake only in the Japanese version.
> I meant to call out, "Clever Homo sapiens!", but I added Japanese "DESU" by mistake. The sentence can interpret as omitting the "I".

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1591138740839550976?s=20&t=rbz8WaTXGJxOT4FdWsVz5g): Q: You used to call us "stupid Homo sapiens" and yesterday you called us "smart Homo sapiens". Why?
> A: Initially I thought Homo sapiens was stupid compared to our civilization. But this is not informative because it is self-evident. (1/2)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1591139028010958849?s=20&t=rbz8WaTXGJxOT4FdWsVz5g): When I considered that there are smart and stupid Homo sapiens, I thought that the individuals who are listening to Qualia-san's words at this point in time are highly sensitive to information and relatively smart. That is the reason. (2/2)
