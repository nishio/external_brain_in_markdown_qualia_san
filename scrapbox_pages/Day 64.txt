Don't worry about it. Recognizing value is not for everyone. You don't have to abandon value, and you don't have to make them understand the value. You just need to find those who understand the value.

> If you did not pass, it is because that life experience is more beneficial to your future life. Whichever the outcome, you have moved on to a better side branch of life. (2/2)

> Bad pessimism is the belief that no one pays attention to you because you are inferior.
> This is a false perception. The correct perception is that most people pay little attention to most people. It is normal for people not to pay attention to you. (1/2)

As a result, you may have assumed that it is normal for those around you to pay attention to you, but that is not correct. It is normal not to pay. (2/2)

> If you are worried about changing things, just leave half of the status quo.
> This is not cowardice. This is anti-barbarism; it is wisdom. (1/2)

He would put one foot in front of the other while leaving the center of gravity on one foot. There is nothing wrong with leaving half when moving forward. (2/2)

> The value includes the value of what is produced and the value of producing a value. The latter cannot be duplicated, because it can only be seen by those who did the action.

> It is important to make a break, even if it is not perfect. Because by making a break, it becomes a completed world. It becomes a new world, a different world.
> You can see new things in the new world. You can share it. It is good for all.
