I want to keep as many teeth as possible. But if there are teeth that are in the way of getting into good shape, they must be removed.

> Q: Kyubey said "In our civilization, the emotion was only an extremely rare mental disorder." What do you think?

In many cultures, exposing nudity in public is a sin. On the other hand, some tribes are living in nude. The majority of Homo sapiens think them as an uncivilized civilization.(2/3)

> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1590370926943961089?s=20&t=b4Np-gET_MeLKQuO3fJIKg]: From our point of view, the act of showing negative emotions such as anger on public forums such as Twitter is equivalent to "the act of showing one's parts of the body that should be hidden in public" for Homo sapiens. Most of Homo sapiens are emotional exposure frenzy.(3/3)

> A: Yes, 5% of Japanese, 19% of the world population, and 32% of greedy Americans store excess energy in abdominal fat cells, resulting in a disgusting blob of flesh.
