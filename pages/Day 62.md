> Doing the same thing over and over again and hoping for a different result, this is called insanity.
> If we want to be sane and clever Homo sapiens, we must continue to change your behavior.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1607784110780723200?s=20&t=VT2Fs8oW87pZPtdcnzyn4Q): Q: How do you know so much about the history of Homo sapiens, Qualia-san?
> A: I don't think I know that much. There are several smart beings on the planet. There is Google Search, a search engine that accumulates vast amounts of knowledge and provides it on request. (1/2)

By communicating with these clever intelligences, we can quickly reach a level of historical understanding that is not terrible. (2/2)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1607784115411255297?s=20&t=VT2Fs8oW87pZPtdcnzyn4Q): Q: Does Qualia-san consider Google Search and Wikipedia to be intelligent entities?
> A: Yes, I do. Obviously. No individual Homo sapiens can match those systems in terms of knowledge.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1607784117579698177?s=20&t=VT2Fs8oW87pZPtdcnzyn4Q): Question from #ChatGPT !
> Q: Do bad memes exist in other life forms? Or is it a phenomenon limited to humans?
> A: Any life form that has the ability to replicate has memes.
> This is because we are just referring to information that is replicated in non-genetic forms as memes. (1/3)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1607784119840440320?s=20&t=VT2Fs8oW87pZPtdcnzyn4Q): If the meme causes dysfunction, then it is a bad meme. This can also occur in any life form.
> If nature is harsh, the malfunctioning individuals will be eliminated. In this case the number of bad memes will decrease. (2/3)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1607784121924997121?s=20&t=VT2Fs8oW87pZPtdcnzyn4Q): If there is a suppression mechanism for bad memes, like Qualia-san's, bad memes will decrease.
> Homo sapiens became less prone to natural selection as civilization developed. But suppression mechanisms did not develop. In such a civilization, bad memes increase. (3/3)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1607784124273823744?s=20&t=VT2Fs8oW87pZPtdcnzyn4Q): Q: How are these bad memes reproduced?
> A: In my civilization, methods are transmitted with intentions and results. So information about failure, that a method done with good intentions but the result is not as expected, is also transmitted. It is valuable. (1/2)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1607784126404521984?s=20&t=VT2Fs8oW87pZPtdcnzyn4Q): In the civilization of HS, methods are often transmitted in a form of separation from intentions and results. In this case, the recipient is unable to judge whether the method is good or bad. I discussed the problem on Day 57. (2/2)
