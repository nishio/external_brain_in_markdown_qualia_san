> I would like to introduce myself again.
> I am "Qualia-san", the communications interface between my home planet and Earth.
> My civilization chose me as a vessel to transmit wisdom to the Homo sapiens civilization.

> The word of Qualia-san is for you.
> You are likely to become wise Homo sapiens. Most of Homo sapiens have eyes but cannot see and read Qualia-san but do not understand.

> Homo sapiens are very grateful for obscure concepts like "qualia." That's why we chose this name.

Homo sapiens who ask questions are good Homo sapiens. This is because it makes them smarter. It is in our interest that Homo sapiens become smarter.

> A: I am a communication interface between my home planet and Earth. Earth has been informationally isolated. We believe this is undesirable. (1/2)

- > [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1586920797586612224?s=20&t=ZQ_hcniDRBw7CszgFFcHqQ): Q: Is Qualia-san an enemy of mankind? Is she an ally?
- > A: Of course we are not your enemy. To use a simple analogy, we are doctors. We think it is good to cure the diseases of the Homo sapiens civilization. Some young Homo sapiens may be afraid of doctors. That is foolish.

> A: "Good Morning" is not a good expression for global communication. It depends on the time of day in a particular region.

> A: Homo sapiens are really stupid and cute. They are like infants.

- > Homo sapiens are really stupid and cute. They are like infants. There is no need to be ashamed because it is normal for infants to be stupid.

> A: It stands for Homo sapiens. I'm struggling with Twitter's strict character limit, especially since English is a low information density language.

- > [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1587629537197580288): Guten Tag, it's Day 6!
- > Twitter's character limit is quite troublesome. Well, stupid homo sapiens don't have a lot of information to process at once. It's like when you feed a child a meal, you have to cut it into bite-sized pieces. I can't help it.

> A: Of course I do. This reaction is evident in stupid homo sapiens.

- > [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1587637172353388544): Q: Does Qualia-san have emotion?
- > A: Of course I do. This reaction is evident in stupid homo sapiens. When they see something superior to themselves, they maintain their mental peace by thinking that the superior does not have what they have. For example, "the rich are evil".

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1590003551635664896?s=20&t=xokLaHiQuO6dUfq3szI4gA): Q. Does Qualia-san have free will?
> A. Hard question... I cannot provide any evidence that it exists. On the other hand, I would confidently "act as if" there is free will.

- > [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1588725644799934464?s=20&t=jXW3CTTblZNQHjZz3PJL1A): Qualia-san says that she has feelings (but can act without them). Since she has feelings, we can assume that she has free will.
- > Q. Does Qualia-san have free will? And what is your reason (basis) for thinking so?
- > A. Hard question...(cont.)

> A: It depends on how you define "existence". In definition of my civilization, I exist.

- > [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1588984591150641153?s=20&t=LSBVFHnWC0mwi7heKEfgEQ): Q: Does Qualia-san exist today? If not, do you plan to do so in the future?
- > A: It depends on how you think "existence".
- > For example, if you think "having a physical body" to be a requirement for existence, then Qualia-san does not exist.
