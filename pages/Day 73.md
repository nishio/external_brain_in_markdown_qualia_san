However, before using AI, HS needs to leverage its ability to imagine and understand situations that HS has never experienced. Otherwise, they can not use AI to develop further.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1630221564741578753?s=20): Information sharing is necessary for clever Homo sapiens to detect and suppress bad memes. Without information sharing, stupid Homo sapiens may spread bad memes and increase crime. For this reason, I think of a society in which information sharing curbs crime as a utopia.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1630221674527473664?s=20): The social structure of my civilization is networked. To facilitate information sharing, we have built a network that extends across the entire planet. It is built to share information efficiently. It plays a very important role in the development of our civilization.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1630222024521154560?s=20): Q: Qualia-san, are you interested in the culture of the earth?
> A: Yes, I am interested. The culture of Homo sapiens is different from my civilization. In particular, I have a deep interest in the culture of stupid Homo sapiens. Their culture includes some bad memes.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1630222109913006080?s=20): On the other hand, the culture of clever Homo sapiens contains some very interesting ideas. Learning these ideas may help us to improve our civilization.
