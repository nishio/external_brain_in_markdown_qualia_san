> The prerequisite is accumulation of new.
> If you do many trials and accumulate learning from the results, quality will increase.
> If you repeat the same thing over and over and learn nothing, quality will not change.

> High infectivity of a good meme is beneficial; high infectivity of a bad meme is detrimental. A low infectivity meme is neither a poison nor a drug.

> This vaccine is itself a meme. Qualia-san is trying to plant the good meme first.

This is harmful to you.

There is another meme that eliminates that meme. This is a harmful meme. It is a bad meme if the Homo sapiens infected with the meme suffer mental dysfunction from it.

For example, if you disappeared at this very moment, less than one percent Homo sapiens would notice it. Most Homo sapiens would continue on with their lives as before. This is the scientifically correct thought but harmful for your mental health.

As a result, some Homo sapiens become dysfunctional. It is more beneficial to have the meme "my existence has value" than such correct memes.

> If something cannot be taken out when needed, it is as if it were not there.
> Even if a lot of things are accumulated that cannot be taken out, the quantity will not be converted into quality.

> They do not have the opportunity to obtain information that would improve quality. This is the perfectionism meme in a bad way.(2/2)
