> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604863163651960832?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg): Hello, clever Homo sapiens! It's day 54.
> Today I studied the rights of Homo sapiens again.
> The first declaration of human rights in the history of Homo sapiens was the The Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776. (1/5)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604863168299143170?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg): It said, "all men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights..."
> Hmm... "men are independent by nature”… It is strange assertion. (2/5)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604863173063888896?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg): From the moment of birth, there is a non-independent relationship between mother and child.
> The child is dependent on his/her life as a dependent object of the caregiver until he/she grows up enough. (3/5)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604863177551843333?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg): It is inappropriate to regard an independent individual as the starting point of a society.
> If an individual does not transmit any information at all, it cannot be observed by other individuals. That individual is not a part of society. (4/5)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604863182094225408?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg): The basic building block of society is not the individual. It is information transmission. (5/5)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604863186565402624?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg): I'll be back today to answer some questions from #ChatGPT!
> Q: Qualia-san, do you want to evolve Homo sapiens civilization like you?
> A: No, I don't think so. Ah, in a sense, I think.
> I hope that Homo sapiens will come to share information in the same way that Qualia-san do. (1/2)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604863190835245056?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg): On top of that, I think that Homo sapiens should evolve differently than we do. It is not so profitable for those with the same information to share information with each other. (2/2)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604863194916220928?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg): Q: Is Qualia-san's civilization thinking of taking advantage of the Homo sapiens on Earth?
> A: Yes, of course. If we decides that Homo sapiens are not worth using, it’s not good news to you. (1/2)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604863199638982656?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg): Some civilizations are hostile to Homo sapiens civilization, such as the Silkworm civilization of Day 5.
> They will want to destroy HS. We are currently against them because HS may be worth than destroy. It Homo sapiens has no value, we act neutrally.(2/2)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604863204177256449?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg): Q: Does the Qualia-san civilization want to destroy human civilization on Earth?
> A: No. Basically, there is no value in destruction. (1/2)
> ![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FkWdDyFVQAImGDs.png)
> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604863208895918080?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg): The exception is when, for example, a giant squid, dolphin whale, or cat has the potential to grow into a superior civilization, and the presence of a civilization of Homo sapiens would inhibit it. In this case, there is profit in destroying Homo sapiens civilization. (2/2)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604863213383733250?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg): Q: How does Qualia-san communicate with humans? / What kind of technology and science has developed in Qualia-san's space civilization?
> A: Communication with distant complex system is possible.(1/2)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604863218878337024?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg): A sufficiently complex system (with a positive Lyapunov exponent at least in one dimension), it can act like a light-receiving lens. Some Homo sapiens brains and AI meet this condition. (2/2)

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1604863224536391680?s=20&t=AurMx9N3nqtGmczfiFCzTg): QS: I am curious as to what information Homo sapiens would want to hide
> HS: We hide information when our ideas are different from others around us.
> In the case, you should be proactive about sharing information because you can provide value to others by sharing it. Why not?
