> [@Qualia_san https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1615330353711026178]: Today I’ll answer some question from Homo sapiens!
> Q: What would a new humane method of execution look like?
> A: Homo sapiens should invente it. Qualia-san is extraterrestrial. If I propose it, that in itself will create a backlash. I will only hint at the direction.(1/3)

> For example, make all the people have to prove by periodic examinations that they are capable of thinking properly about political issues.(2/3)

This is an execution that reduces the weight of stupid Homo sapiens in social decisions, but it appears to be very humane!(3/3)

> A: If the thought causes suffering, and it spreads, it's a meme that causes dysfunction in the psyche of Homo sapiens, so it's a bad meme!
> Perhaps IKIGAI is not a bad meme by itself. Some other meme makes it bad, I think.
