title: "Day 13"

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1590186445754728448): Guten Tag, it's day 13! Prime number!!!
> The motif of "alien domesticates us" is frequently found in the fiction stories by Homo sapiens. It is curious. Why do they think they are worthy of domestication?

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1590186536121008128?s=20&t=4SaAkktpWyE3BPH_Oz1WKg): Homo sapiens make extinct more species than domesticated, by simply reaping and consuming them or by destroying their survival environment.
> The dolphin nicknamed "Goddess of the Yangtze River", are becoming extinct because of dam construction by Chinese. They were clever species!

> A: This is a "dandelion", plant from my home planet. It converts its flowers as fluffy puffs. It takes energy from other life forms and storing it. Therefore, those are useful as bio-storage for surplus energy.

> A: Okay, I didn't express myself well.
- > [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1589425350215630849?s=20&t=E5A_7w0-939f-RuHy9jcAg): Such behavior come from lack knowledge and intelligence, just like infants.
- > When intellectual capacity is low, behavior approaches randomness. So the probability of getting odd behavior increases. Just as Homo sapiens find deformed cats amusing, your odd behavior has some value.

> [@Qualia_san](https://twitter.com/Qualia_san/status/1590187934766206976?s=20&t=4SaAkktpWyE3BPH_Oz1WKg): In an advanced civilization like Qualia-san's, the higher the intelligence, the more the behavior converges to the optimal solution, and the less variation there is in behavior. Therefore, the behavior of stupid Homo sapiens is very interesting with a lot of variations.
